            <i>perform the following assessments</i>
          </h5>

            <li>1) Industry/market trends: separate slide. </li>
            <li>
              2) Technology trends: Examine the technology trends in your own
              industry and ask how you can best use them to your advantage. The
              question is not whether technology trends will affect your
              industry, but how.
            </li>
            <li>3) Competitors assessment: separate slide.</li>
            <li>
              4) Social and regulatory environment: All companies exist as
              integral parts of society-at-large, and are affected by powerful
              social, regulatory, and political forces. Keep abreast of these
              forces and assess how they might affect your company. Astute
              anticipation of governmental moves or regulatory-body decisions
              can create tremendous opportunities. Conversely, ignorance of the
              same can be disastrous.
            </li>
            <li>
              5) Macroeconomy & demographics: Examine the general macroeconomic
              climate and assess what impact the overall economy might have on
              your company. Pay particular attention to demographic trends.
              Entire industries can be dramatically affected by demographic
              changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              6) International threats & opportunities: Factor international
              into your strategic thinking, even if you don't currently sell in
              foreign markets. International strategy is relevant for all
              companies; no matter what your size, there will probably be forces
              pulling you into the international arena.
            </li>
            <li>
              7) Overall threats and opportunities: In preparing for a strategy
              session, ask a selected group of employees, managers, and
              objective outsiders to list the top three external opportunities
              and top three external threats facing the company. This is a quick
              and efficient way to tap the insights of a range of people as
              input to your external assessment.
